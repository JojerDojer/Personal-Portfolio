    <p>I'm John Davidson, an aspiring web developer based in Fort Worth, Texas. I'm fueled by a deep
       passion for learning about web development technologies and the art of building beautiful
       websites. From a young age, I've been captivated by technology, video games, computers, and
       the vastness of the internet, which has inspired me to embark on this journey of web development.
       <br>
       <br>
       As a newcomer to this field, I'm eagerly soaking up knowledge and honing my skills to create
       compelling online experiences. I approach each project with a humble mindset, recognizing that
       there is always more to learn and discover. With a combination of my technical abilities and
       creative thinking, I'm committed to crafting visually appealing and functional websites.
       I'm excited to contribute my growing expertise and passion to the ever-evolving world of web development.
      <br>
      <br>
      When I'm not working or applying myself to learning web development, I am looking for every opportunity to
      get outside and be active. I love working out, playing pickleball, volleyball, spikeball, or really any game that
      revolves around a ball. I also really enjoy watching movies, playing video games, listening to music, and
      hanging out with friends.</p>
